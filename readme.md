## Installation

Install plugin by OctoberCMS plugin updater.

Go to Settings â€“> Updates&Plugins find Gutenberg in plugin search. Click on icon and install it.

## Usage

This plugin works only by implementing Gutenberg behavior in your model. 
It will create morphOne relation with `Gutenberg\Content` model.

Go to your model and add behavior in $implement array:

```php
public $implement = ['ReaZzon.Gutenberg.Behaviors.Gutenbergable'];
```

After you need to add behavior to $implement array in your model controller.

```php
public $implement = ['ReaZzon.Gutenberg.Behaviors.GutenbergController'];
```

Done. Your model now has morphOne with `Gutenberg\Content` Model by `content` field.

## Rendering

Rendering examples below. 

```twig
{{ post.content.render }}
```
 
```
$post->content->render();
```

In order to correctly display Gutenberg styles. You must add laraberg public styles to your page:
```html
<link href="/plugins/reazzon/gutenberg/assets/laraberg.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Working with source js code

If you want add some features you can work with source react files in /formwidgets/gutenberg/assets/resources folder run following commands:
```bash
npm i
npm run watch
```
